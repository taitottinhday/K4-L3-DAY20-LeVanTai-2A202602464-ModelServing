# 02 - Continuous batching under load (u50)

Host `Windows-AMD64` · `--parallel 4` · 15 samples over

| Gauge | Peak observed |
|:--|--:|
| `n_busy_slots_per_decode` (avg/decode) | 3.85 of 4 slots (96%) |
| `requests_processing` | 4 |
| `requests_deferred` | 46 |
| `kv_cache_usage_ratio` | n/a — not exported by llama.cpp `b10488` |
| `tokens_predicted_total` (final) | 3014 |

Highest sampled value was **3.85 of 4** slots. Note this gauge is llama.cpp's *average* busy slots per decode step, so the number below is the highest average we sampled, not an instantaneous maximum batch width. A peak near 1 means
requests were served one at a time -- either the load was too light to overlap, or
they arrived too far apart. A peak approaching `--parallel` means the scheduler was
genuinely packing concurrent requests into shared decode steps.
`requests_deferred` went above zero: more requests arrived than there were slots, so some waited. That wait is the queue time in your P95.

## Your observation

Peak average busy slots reached 3.85/4 (96%), while `requests_processing` reached
4 and `requests_deferred` reached 46. This directly proves that continuous batching
packed nearly all four decode slots and that excess requests queued. Effective
concurrency is higher (12.4) because Little's Law counts both active and queued
requests; I trust the server gauge for batch width and the effective-concurrency
figure for total work resident in the system.
